Predicting the **3D structure** of **RNA molecules** is a challenging task due to limited training data and RNA specificities, but could lead to a better understanding of its functions and to the creation of new therapeutics. This repository aims to maintain a curated list of **awesome deep learning methods** to predict RNA 3D structure.

## üíæ Databanks and datasets

### Databanks

3D structures are generally optained from the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/). Challenging structures, generally used to evaluate models' performances can be found during the [RNA-Puzzles](http://www.rnapuzzles.org/) and [CASP15](https://predictioncenter.org/casp15/) challenges.

Some models use distillation to augment the data, since available RNA structures are limited. They often use the [bpRNA-1m](https://bprna.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/) database that contains annotated secondary structures.

### Datasets

Researchers often use their own methods to build datasets, separating between training and test sets based on sequence identity and thus not accounting for structural similarities.

- **RNA3DB** : a dataset created for machine learning training with train-test separation accounting for sequence and structural similarities.
