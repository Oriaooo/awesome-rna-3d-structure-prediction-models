Predicting the **3D structure** of **RNA molecules** is a challenging task due to limited training data and RNA specificities, but could lead to a better understanding of its functions and to the creation of new therapeutics. This repository aims to maintain a curated list of **awesome deep learning methods** to predict RNA 3D structure.

> Note that we do not include scoring functions or inverse folding methods, which are seen as a different topics.

## üíæ Databanks and datasets

### Databanks

3D structures are generally optained from the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/). Challenging structures, generally used to evaluate models' performances can be found during the [RNA-Puzzles](http://www.rnapuzzles.org/) and [CASP15](https://predictioncenter.org/casp15/) challenges.

Some models use distillation to augment the data, since available RNA structures are limited. They often use the [bpRNA-1m](https://bprna.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/) database that contains annotated secondary structures.

### Datasets

Researchers often use their own methods to build datasets, separating between training and test sets based on sequence identity and thus not accounting for structural similarities.

- **RNA3DB** : a dataset created for machine learning training with train-test separation accounting for sequence and structural similarities.

## ‚ú® Models

### üìÜ 2022

- **DeepFoldRNA** : this model predicts simulation constraints with transformer-based blocks like AlphaFold 2, to guide energy minimization simulations that produce the structures.

- **RhoFold** : the first structure prediction method using deep learning only. Its architecture is close to AlphaFold 2 with transformers blocks and structure module. It uses of a foundation model for sequence embedding.

### üìÜ 2023

- **epRNA** : this model predicts distances between pairs of residues from the sequence only using convolutionnal neurol networks. Refinement with force fields is used to obtain full-atom structures.

- **DRfold** : this method uses the sequence and predicted secondary structure to predict rotation/translation matrices and geometric constraints. Both are then used to guide an optimization process that leads to the structure.

- **NuFold** : an adaptation of AlphaFold 2's architecture to RNAs: frame definition and vocabulary changed, auxiliary networks added and templates replaced by secondary structure (predicted).

- **trRosettaRNA** : a transformer-based network similar to AlphaFold 2 which predicts 1D and 2D geometries used as constraints to guide folding based on energy minimization.

    [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-blue?logo=Read.cv&labelColor=grey)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42528-4)

- **RoseTTAFoldNA** : an adaptation of the RoseTTAFold2 model to predict protein-nucleic acid complexes. It updates 1D, 2D and 3D molecule representations that are fed into a SE(3) transformer and a model that predicts frame and rotation angles.
